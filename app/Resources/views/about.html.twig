                            <p>I fear there remains a gap between <em>who I am</em> and <em>who I want to be</em> 
                            but there can be no doubt that I am a <strong>lucky guy! :)</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Â¿Why?</strong> To answer this question you should know my family and my friends...;)</p>
                            <p>I have learned well from many people and hope to continue. </p>
                            <p>I have had the good fortune of <strong>traveling</strong> to many areas of Europe and this has allowed me to widen perspectives, discover my limitations and to entrench some values as the respect for other cultures.</p>
                            <p>I am privileged to be able to <strong>study</strong> and choose in what fields wanted to learn more to balance my routines and bring me goals to enable to continue growing.</p>
